## Stroke-prediction-model

### Project Overview

This project is focused on predictive modeling in the healthcare domain. The objective is to develop a **binary classification model** that accurately predicts whether a patient is at risk of a **stroke** based on medical and demographic attributes.

The final model aims to aid in **early detection** and **preventive care planning**.

### Objective

- Build a robust **classification model** to predict stroke occurrence.
- Class label:
  - `0`: No Stroke
  - `1`: Stroke

### Techniques Used

- Data Preprocessing & Encoding
- Handling Missing Values
- Feature Engineering
- Train-Test Splitting
- Model Training:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Support Vector Machine
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve
  - Confusion Matrix
